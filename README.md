American Sign Language Interpreter

http://course.ece.cmu.edu/~ece500/projects/f20-teamb6/

Our project aimed to tackle a need we recognized in the world of assistive technology for Deaf persons. Today those with hearing disabilities communicate through sign language, while only a small percentage of hearing-able persons have an understanding of sign language. So we endeavored to create a system that can visually detect American Sign Language hand signs and translate them in real time. Through the use of computer vision and machine learning technology, we aimed to develop this system to improve the everyday lives of deaf persons.
